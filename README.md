# Citizen Engagement Web Toolkit


The Citizen Engagement Web Toolkit features a collection of tools and resources used in online engagements with citizens of the Province of British Columbia.  A key component is the WordPress blogging platform which supports the Province's engagement hub [govTogether](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/govtogetherbc/index.page).

The Citizen Engagement team wants to expand the functionality of the WordPress platform.  The vision is to tap into the WordPress online community through shared theme development, plugin development, and other innovative ideas to create reusable components for business solutions in a safe and secure way.  This collaborative effort is looking for talented WordPress developers with a knack for PHP, MySQL, CSS, and JavaScript.
